# Development Priorities and Order

## Evaluate Necessity for MVP:
- **Token Minting (`GZEMinting.js`)**: Essential for creating the initial supply of tokens. Necessary.
- **DAO Wallet Setup (`DAOwallet.js`)**: Required for governance and secure storage of funds. Necessary.
- **Token Distribution (`TokenDistribution.js`)**: Needed to allocate tokens according to your plan. Necessary.
- **Disable Further Minting (`DisableMinting.js`)**: Important to secure the token economy. Necessary.
- **Token Burn Functionality**: Evaluate based on tokenomics.
- **"Leak" Functionality (`Leak.js`)**: Important but evaluate if critical for MVP launch.

## Resource Optimization:
Focus on foundational tasks: Token Minting, DAO Wallet Setup, Token Distribution, Disable Further Minting.

## Prioritization Based on Criticality:
- **Critical**: Token Minting, DAO Wallet Setup, Token Distribution, Disable Further Minting.
- **Evaluate for MVP**: Token Burn Functionality, "Leak" Functionality.

## Recommended Order of Development:
1. **Token Minting (`GZEMinting.js`)**
2. **DAO Wallet Setup (`DAOwallet.js`)**
3. **Token Distribution (`TokenDistribution.js`)**
4. **Disable Further Minting (`DisableMinting.js`)**

## Post-MVP Considerations:
- **Token Burn Functionality**: Depending on economic model.
- **"Leak" Functionality (`Leak.js`)**: Unique feature for enhancing the token ecosystem.
