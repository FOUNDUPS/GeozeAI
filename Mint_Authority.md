# Mint Authority Secure Storage Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended approach for securely storing and retrieving the `MINT_AUTHORITY` keypair, essential for the GZE token minting process.

## Objective
Ensure the `MINT_AUTHORITY` keypair is stored securely and is accessible only by authorized scripts and personnel, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or loss.

## Recommended Storage Solution
After evaluating several options, we recommend using [Choose Storage Solution: AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.] for storing the `MINT_AUTHORITY` keypair. This solution offers [brief explanation of why this solution is chosen].

## Steps for Secure Storage

### 1. Generating the Keypair
The `MINT_AUTHORITY` keypair should be generated in a secure environment. Ensure that the generation process does not expose the private key.

### 2. Storing the Keypair
- **For Environment Variables**:
  - Store the secret key or seed phrase in environment variables within a secure, server-side environment.
  - Utilize `.env` files for local development, ensuring `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.

- **For Encrypted Storage Solutions**:
  - Use [Storage Solution] to create a new secret.
  - Store the private key of the `MINT_AUTHORITY` as the secret value.

### 3. Accessing the Keypair
Document the process for authorized scripts or personnel to access the `MINT_AUTHORITY` keypair. This might involve setting up access controls, API calls to the storage solution, or loading environment variables.

## Retrieval in Application
Provide a code snippet or procedure for securely loading the `MINT_AUTHORITY` keypair into the application, ensuring that it is done in a way that minimizes exposure.

Example:
```javascript
// Example using environment variables
const { Keypair } = require('@solana/web3.js');
const secretKey = process.env.MINT_AUTHORITY_SECRET_KEY;
const mintAuthorityKeypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(JSON.parse(secretKey)));
