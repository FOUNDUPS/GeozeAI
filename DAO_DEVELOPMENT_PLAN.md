# DAO Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for the DAO, focusing on the MVP phase. It applies a prioritization framework to ensure efficient and impactful development.

## Prioritization Criteria
1. **Necessity for MVP**: Is it essential?
2. **Resource Optimization**: Can we afford to develop it now?
3. **Criticality**: Can we live without it because something else is more important?

## Phase 1: Roadmap to $1M Market Cap
Phase 1 centralizes governance through Delegate Pro-tem voting to streamline initial decision-making. Expansion to broader stakeholder participation, facilitated by KYC-verified voting, is envisioned post the $1M market cap achievement.

## MVP Development Priorities
1. **Delegate Pro-tem Voting**: Implement an interim governance model to expedite foundational decisions.
2. **Stake Voting**: Empower token holders with governance influence, laying the groundwork for foundational governance.
3. **Bounty System**: Foster community engagement and accelerate project momentum by rewarding contributions.
4. **Delegate System**: Establish a rudimentary framework for delegate governance, with plans for sophistication in subsequent phases.

### Post-Phase 1 Enhancements
- **Expand Stakeholder Voting with KYC**: Post $1M market cap, integrate KYC verification to democratize voting beyond pro-tem delegates.
- **Refine the Delegate System**: Post-initial phase, evolve the delegate governance model to enhance community representation and decentralization.
- **Innovate with "Leak" Functionality**: Introduce an automated token-swap feature to stimulate engagement and enrich the token ecosystem.
- **Leverage AI for DAO Automation**: Post-MVP, explore AI implementations to streamline operations and foster data-driven governance.

## Additional Considerations
### Stakeholder Voting (KYC-based One Person, One Vote)
Initially deferred, subsequent to the $1M market cap milestone, broadening community voting through KYC verification will ensure equitable governance participation.

### Bounty System
A pivotal element from the outset, the Bounty System is instrumental in catalyzing community involvement and contribution, crucial for early-stage growth.

## Conclusion
This DAO development plan orchestrates a structured approach to constructing the DAO, focusing on pivotal features for the MVP and outlining an evolutionary path post the initial market cap milestone. Our commitment to scalable governance, community engagement, and operational efficiency guides our phased development strategy.
